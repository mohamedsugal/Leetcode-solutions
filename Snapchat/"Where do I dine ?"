"Where do I dine ?"

Your solution will be scored against some number of hidden test cases. A sample is provided below.


Instructions:

You have been given a timestamp and an API endpoint that returns a list of food trucks. The goal is to write a set of functions that provide a list of food trucks' applicants and locationids fetched from the given API endpoint using the given timestamp.



In this program, you’ll need to:

Include an HTTP authorization header, in the format of "Authorization: Basic xxxxx" (please get the header value from the input box)
Convert the UNIX timestamp given to extract the day of the week, hour, minutes (UTC format).
Use the time extracted above as parameters to fetch the data of the food trucks that open at the given time and day from the given API. 
Your request should have the following parameters: hour, minutes, dayOrder
List the names of food trucks that get from the API.
If no matches are found print "N/A" (without quote)
If endpoint hits an error, print "N/A" (without quote)


Input:

You will be provided with an array of strings with three values:

The first element is the URL for fetching food truck data.
The second element is the UNIX timestamp to be used to extract day and time (UTC format).
The third element is the API token needed in the authorization header when fetching food truck data.
See sample input for an example.
DayOrder represents the day of the week in integer (0 represents Sunday).
﻿

Here's what the data from this GET request will look like:

[{
      "DayOrder":2,
      "DayOfWeekStr":"Tuesday",
      "starttime":"10AM",
      "endtime":"6PM",
      "permit":"19MFF-00105",
      "PermitLocation":"773 MARKET ST",
      "locationdesc":"Pushcart located on Market St. 7 linear feet West of the Fire Hydrant. Must maintain 8 linear feet clearance from Street Artist Booth M22. Reference Street Artist Map #14 (http:\/\/www.sfartscommission.org\/street_artists_program\/maps\/index.html)",
      "optionaltext":"Kettle Corn, Funnel Cakes, Lemonade, Beverages, Flan, Hot Dogs, Falafel, Hot and Cold Sandwiches, French Fries, Baklava and Pastries",
      "locationid":1341056,
      "scheduleid":null,
      "start24":"10:00",
      "end24":"18:00",
      "CNN":8746103,
      "Addr_Date_Create":"11\/15\/2011 01:48:04 PM",
      "Addr_Date_Modified":"11\/15\/2011 01:50:08 PM",
      "block":"3706",
      "lot":"096",
      "ColdTruck":"N",
      "Applicant":"Kettle Corn Star",
      "X":"6,011,164.82111",
      "Y":"2,114,324.40143",
      "Latitude":37.7861609344,
      "Longitude":-122.4051273113,
      "Location":"(37.7861609344287, -122.405127311306)"
   }, ...]


Output:

Output must match the provided "Sample Output" format with no quotes, additional leading spaces, or trailing spaces.

Your output should be a list of food truck Applicants that are open at the time and date provided in form of the UNIX timestamp in alphabetical order.
Each food truck should be in the format of "Applicant, locationid"(Applicant and locationid, with a ", "in the middle)
For example, if it's Friday, May 5 at 12 pm, then I should only see food trucks that are open then.
If no matches are found return N/A


Note about the write-up: 

You'll be asked for a written explanation of your solution. 
Please use this opportunity to showcase your technical expertise describing how you would take this proof-of-concept command-line application and convert it to a fully-featured web application using the data provided by an API capable of serving millions of concurrent users. 
Imagine this write-up will be used to pitch your architecture to the team so make sure to explain why you would make those choices. 
Please write 300-400 words explaining the above points.


Tips:

The timestamp is in UNIX format, make sure you are converting it correctly (UTC format).
To test proper timestamp use the following: 1578830400.0 will convert to 12 January 2020 12pm.
You should test different variations of the input data and verify the output. Your final score is calculated against a list of different inputs and expected outputs.
Depending on the language you are using, you may be able to install additional libraries, however, you shouldn't need anything extra to complete this challenge.
Just like a real web service, do not assume that the request will always succeed!
